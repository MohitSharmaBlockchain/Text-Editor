                <p>Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) is a joint project of The University of California Los
                    Angeles (UCLA), The University of Oxford, and The Max Planck Institute for the History of Science,
                    Berlin. It represents the efforts of an international group of Assyriologists, museum curators, and
                    historians of science to make the form and content of cuneiform inscriptions available through the
                    internet dating from the beginning of writing, ca. 3350 BC, until the end of the pre-Christian era.

                    As a Google Summer of Code student, I worked with the CDLI as a designer and frontend developer to
                    improve the user experience of CDLI's website.I collobrated with GSoC students as well on the
                    Userflow
                    and other required UI screens.

                                view</span></a></h2>
                    <p>This dashboard is supposed to be used by Admins and Editors. It consists of around 20 different
                        admin function controls. The first step was to categorize them followed by deciding each
                        category positioning based on hierarchy in terms of how frequently they are used.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>In research conducted via interviews and weekly design meetings, we concluded that different
                        users are handling different sections, the Admin dashboard is accessed through desktop as well
                        as mobile devices, and most of the functions had 2 actions associated with them i.e. adding a
                        new entry and viewing/editing an existing entry thus cards were the best option as a UI element
                        for each function.</p>

                            class="anchor"><span>Mobile view</span></a></h2>
                    <p>Admin dashboard consists of around 20 cards that are bifurcated under six categories but
                        bombarding the user with so many options altogether not just affect the cognition load but also
                        increases scrolling which causes a problem in the navigation to the actual function they wanted
                        to use, therefore I have used accordions for the categories.
                        <br><br>
                        <a href="https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jakob’s law</a> states
                        that users spend most of their time on other sites, which suggest that it is preferred that your
                        site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. So I have used the circular
                        button at the bottom-right corner because users who are going to the user admin dashboard were
                        very familiar with the mobile interface of apps like Gmail and Slack

                    ## Raw Image Scan


                    <p style="margin-bottom:0px;">An cuboidal artifact consists of 6 side:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Obverse (O)</li>
                        <li>Reverse (R)</li>
                        <li>Left Edge (LE)</li>
                        <li>Right Edge (RE)</li>
                        <li>Top Edge (TE)</li>
                        <li>Bottom Edge (BE)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In order to digitize it, the backend was developed in such a way that an artifact's each side is
                        either scanned using a scanner or photos are taken using a DSLR, each scan can be up to 70 MB. A
                        user with admin dashboard access is supposed to save its name as "ArtifactID_edgeName'' (eg.
                        247_O where 247 is Artifact ID and O stands for Obverse face.), and after successfully uploading
                        them, a black background is added to each scan and all 6 sides are stacked together.</p>

                        <p>Problem : There was no reference for the set of rules that should be followed for uploading
                            images and there were substantial chances of error of using wrong naming convention and then
                            that scan has to be renamed and uploaded again..</p>

                    <p>Since some sides can be identified even after looking at it, an option to preview and rename even
                        after uploading will save plenty of time and reduce the chances of further mistakes. Also since
                        this task consists of various stages, using a stepper will keep the users updated on the
                        progress and since the whole upload process is dependent on naming conventions, a user must go
                        through a naming convention hence should be the first step before continuing to upload, which is
                        a very redundant process.</p>
