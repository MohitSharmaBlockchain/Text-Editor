          <h1>Sticky Sidebar Tutorial</h1>
          <p>Sticky sidebar nav menu has it's hybrid position combined as relative and fixed. Normally the sidebar behaves like a normal element with its position:relative property. But as we scroll up the cotent, the sidebar moves up a certain portion and then sticks as it reaches a threshold point. For that we will be using property:sticky which is relatively new concept to CSS3.</p>
      
          <h3> Introduction</h3>
          <p>Let's briefly understand what we are going to develop in this tutorial as a sticky navbar menu using html and CSS.  We will have a basic header footer and contents with sidebar fixed to the side in this example. Now as we scroll up you can see that the every elements on the page gets scrolled up.  But as the sidebar reaches a threshold point, it gets stuck to that point and while others move, the nav menu doesn't. We will be building this sticky feature of sidebar nav menu which gets fixed when we scroll using simple HTML and CSS. </p>
      
          <h3>HTML -- HyperText Markup Language</h3>
          <p>We have used HTML and CSS to develop sticky sidebar Menu, in this tutorial. We've made use of sticky positioning for that purpose</p>
      
          <h3>CSS -- Cascading StyleSheet</h3>
          <p>we will be using property:sticky which is relatively new concept to CSS3.Sticky sidebar nav menu has it's hybrid position combined as relative and fixed.</p>
      
          <h3>JS -- JavaScript</h3>
          <p> We will be not be making use of JavaScript at all. All our development process will revolve around HTML and CSS only. Though you can make use of javaScript as you prefer.</p>
      
          <h3>Position:Sticky</h3>
          <p>Sticky position is a combination of relative postiioning and fixed positioning. When an element is declared as sticky postion. We need to add other property top, left, right or bottom to set a threshold from which the element gets stick as we scroll up the contents. This position is relatively new to CSS3 and so most developers have been using Javascript for sticky position of element. As this position took a long time to get browser support. Still it is n't supported by internet explorer or edge 15 and earlier versions. To support it in safari we need to add vendor prefix -webkit-.</p>
